## 🐱‍🏍 **About Me** 

### ✌ I am a software developer focused on **Front End Web Development** who holds a **Masters of Science in Software Development** (March 2024). 

### 💔 I am looking for work as I was just laid off due to the company I was working with changing their product roadmap and was hit in the third round of layoffs. I have a strong reference and a letter of recommendation from management and I am still thankful for the time I spent at the company.


### 🧙‍♂️ Outside of the tech world I am a hybrid class of jock nerd meaning I am a nerd who enjoys working out as much as I do DND. At home, my wife and I love to cuddle up and play video games, read, and watch anime as much as we love to use our home gym and push our limits. I firmly believe a heathly body helps make a healthy mind.

### 🐱‍👤 I have two fur children Olive the dog and Bee the cat and they are the two greatest animals of all time.
