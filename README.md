## 🐱‍🏍 **About Me** 

### ✌ I am a full stack software developer who holds a **Masters of Science in Software Development** (degrees arent everything). 

### 🧙‍♂️ Outside of the tech world I am a hybrid class of jock nerd meaning I am a nerd who enjoys working out as much as I do DND. At home, my wife and I love to cuddle up and play video games, read, and watch anime as much as we love to use our home gym and push our limits. I firmly believe a heathly body helps make a healthy mind.

### 🐱‍👤 I have two fur children Olive the dog and Bee the cat and they are the two greatest animals of all time.
